This repository contains files to make figures showing the steps in the chymotrypsin mechanism.

There are files MarvinJS file ending in .mrv to reconstruct the chemical formulas of active site residues and molecules bound to the active site. Figures were saved out of MarvinJS as .png files with a size of 1200 by 1200 pixels.

There are multiple versions of the image files. Files ending in _color are colored versions of the parent images (GIMP's color->map->exchange color was used to recolor). Files ending in _erode have thicker lines (GIMP's filter->general->erode method was used after merging the transparent layers with a white background.

The .xcf file contains the transparent layers ready to be opened in GIMP. By selected the appropriate layers, you can make the different stages in the mechanism.

The .pptx file contains all the figures as a slide show.
